<UpgradeStatus date="~2021/22">
    This upgrade will follow the arrival of shard chains. But it’s the moment where the <a href="/eth2/vision/">Eth2 vision</a> becomes fully realised – more scalability, security, and sustainability with staking supporting the whole network.
</UpgradeStatus>

## What is the docking? {#what-is-the-docking}

It's important to remember that initially, the other Eth2 upgrades are being shipped separately from [mainnet](/glossary/#mainnet) - the chain we use today. Ethereum mainnet will continue to be secured by [proof-of-work](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), even while [the Beacon Chain](/eth2/beacon-chain/) and its [shard chains](/eth2/shard-chains/) run in parallel using [proof of stake](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/). The docking is when these two systems are merged together.

Imagine Ethereum is a space ship that isn’t quite ready for an interstellar voyage. With the Beacon Chain and the shard chains the community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. When it’s time, the current ship will dock with this new system so it can become one ship, ready to put in some serious lightyears and take on the universe.

## Docking mainnet {#docking-mainnet}

When ready, Ethereum mainnet will "dock" with the Beacon Chain, becoming its own shard which uses proof-of-stake instead of [proof of work](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/).

Mainnet will bring the ability to run smart contracts into the proof-of-stake system, plus the full history and current state of Ethereum, to ensure that the transition is smooth for all ETH holders and users.

<!-- ### Improving mainnet

Before mainnet docks with the new eth2 system, it’s probably worthwhile sorting some of the issues that are in flight – often referred to as Ethereum1.x.

These include Improvements for

- **End users**: like [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) which changes the way users bid for blockspace. In other words, making transaction fees more efficient for end users.
- **Client runners**: making running clients more sustainable by capping disk space requirements.
- **Developers**: upgrading the EVM to be more flexible.

Plus many more.

[More on Ethereum1.x](/en/learn/#eth-1x)

These improvements all have a place in Eth2 so it’s likely that their progress may affect the timing of the docking. -->

## After the docking {#after-the-docking}

This will signal the end of proof-of-work for Ethereum and start the era of a more sustainable, eco-friendly Ethereum. At this point Ethereum will have the scale, security and sustainability outlined in its [Eth2 vision](/eth2/vision/).

## Relationship between upgrades {#relationship-between-upgrades}

The Eth2 upgrades are all somewhat interrelated. So let’s recap how the docking relates to the other upgrades.

### Docking and the Beacon Chain {#docking-and-beacon-chain}

Once the docking happens, stakers will be assigned to validate the Ethereum mainnet. Just like with the shard chains. [Mining](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/) will no longer be required so miners will likely invest their earnings into staking in the new proof-of-stake system.

### Docking and shard chains {#docking-and-shard-chains}

With mainnet becoming a shard, the successful implementation of the shard chains is critical to this upgrade. It’s likely that the transition will play an important role in helping the community to decide whether to roll out a second upgrade to sharding. This upgrade will make the other shards like mainnet: they’ll be able to handle transactions and smart contracts and not just provide more data.
